# SmartShop
A user enters a shop(item store) with a list of items(called wishList) he needs to buy. Upon entering he will encounter main beacon which will inform about the list of all available items in the shop. Now a list of available items can be made from the wishList (called as availableList), he now starts moving inside the shop, on encountering the proximity of a shop he would be informed about the available items in the proximity of that beacon, so that he can pickup those items without wasting time in figuring out different items at different places. At the end a billList can be prepared, which can be sent to the shopkeeper to prepare a bill and perform checkout !!
